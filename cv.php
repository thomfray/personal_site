                <h2>Profile</h2>

                <p>In the last 10 years my roles within the library have become increasingly technical and IT-focused, with this being the element of my work I enjoy the most. I am now looking for a role as a developer.</p>
                <p>I am highly organised with a continuous improvement mind-set and excellent problem-solving skills. I am committed to high standards of excellence and great customer service. I am dedicated to my professional development and am always expanding my skillset and knowledge.</p>
                <p>In my current role, I lead development groups for the core library systems to steer their continual improvement. I have project management experience, having led on high-profile projects including the implementation of a new user interface for the library’s main search tool. I also have a passion for data and analytics.</p>
